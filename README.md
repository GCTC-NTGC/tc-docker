# TalentCloud docker integration

Run and develop with just git and docker installed on your system.  Tested on Linux, Mac and Windows.

## Run the stack

To get started, clone the TalentCloud repo to this directory. 

#### HTTPS
```
$ git clone  https://github.com/GCTC-NTGC/TalentCloud.git
```

#### SSH
```
$ git clone git@github.com:GCTC-NTGC/TalentCloud.git
```

From this directory run:

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

### Default Environment

You can setup talent cloud in various ways by editing the `.env` the following instructions are for if you are using the default environment configuration.

Make a hosts entry for talent.local.ca that points to localhost, 
you should then be able to access the application at https://talent.local.ca/ 
(you will need to accept the self-signed certificate).
